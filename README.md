# This App
This app is meant to allow you to have multiple 'access by specific link' youtube playlists and/or a *.txt file of which you want to search and download the audio off of.
This app expects you to have the correct youtube-dl installed along with the necessary version of ffmpeg.

# TODO
- [ ] Allow input of a text file to search and download
- [ ] Allow multiple youtube playlist links
- [ ] Some sort of tracking system to know what has already been downloaded or not
- [ ] Potentially a precision size checker to find what songs are identical and remove duplicates
- [ ] Multithreading (if useful)
